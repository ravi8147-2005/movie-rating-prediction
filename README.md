🎬 Movie Rating Prediction using Python

Welcome to my Movie Rating Prediction project! This machine learning-based solution was developed to estimate the rating of a movie using key features such as genre, director, actors, budget, and more. The project simulates real-world movie industry data and demonstrates how regression models can be used to uncover the patterns behind what makes a movie successful — all through Python-powered data science and Data Analyst techniques.

✨ Project Features  
✅ Regression-based movie rating prediction model  
🎭 Uses key features like genre, director, cast, and budget  
📊 Visualizes actual vs predicted ratings  
🧹 Full data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline  
📈 Model evaluation using R² score and Mean Absolute Error

🛠️ Tools Used  
Python – for data processing, feature engineering, and model training  
Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation  
scikit-learn – for regression modeling  
Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization  
Jupyter Notebook – for development and experimentation  
Power BI & Excel – for data exploration and dashboarding  

📁 Dataset  
Source: TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits Dataset  
Format: CSV (.csv)  
Columns include: Title, Genre, Director, Cast, Budget, Popularity, Runtime, and Rating  

🎯 Project Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical movie data and help stakeholders:  
🎬 Predict a movie’s rating based on available features  
🎯 Identify which factors most influence ratings  
📊 Explore how genre, director, and cast affect movie success  
🚀 Enable smarter pre-release decisions using predictive analytics  

🧠 Key Learnings  
✅ Learned to clean and transform real-world movie data    
📈 Built and evaluated regression models using scikit-learn  
📊 Understood how feature importance can be extracted and visualized  
🛠️ Practiced full ML workflow: cleaning → modeling → evaluation → visualization
